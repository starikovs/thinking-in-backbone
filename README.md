# Backbone implementation of "Thinking in React" example, using ES6.

Hi! In this code example I'm going to try to implement [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) example but using Backbone+ES6. 

Recently I've found that you can follow React's philosophy when building Backbone views. Also, you can use Backbone models 
for **state**.

The source code is here, in this GitHub repository. You can open the **demo** in JSFiddle **https://jsfiddle.net/infous/gwntd5nw/**.
